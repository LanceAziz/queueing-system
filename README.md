# Queueing System Project

This project is a comprehensive queue management system designed to streamline the process of serving clients. It is currently **deployed in an educational institution in Cairo, Egypt**. The system consists of three distinct portals, each serving a unique purpose in the queueing process:

## Portals

### 1. Admin Portal
- **Functionality**: Only the admin can register accounts for the teller users.
- **Security**: Authentication is enforced to ensure that only authorized personnel can manage teller accounts.

### 2. Services Portal
- **Functionality**: Clients are created in the database while waiting to be served.
- **Integration**: Includes a thermal printer to print the client's number in the form of a receipt.

</p>

### 3. Teller Portal
- **Functionality**: Teller users authenticate themselves, and upon successful login, they access a dashboard to serve the next client.
- **Display Integration**: The current client number is displayed on a 2.3-inch 7-segment 3-digit display.
